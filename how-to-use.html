<h1>Hello, and welcome to Overwatch Tools – Alpha release!</h1>

<h2>What is this site?</h2>
<p>This is a counter-picker tool that is aimed at beginners and intermediate players. Getting your ass kicked by Genji? Junkrat keeps blowing you up? We’ll give you recommendations to guide you to victory!</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>First, select on the left the heroes you wish to counter. It can be as few as one, or as many as the entire enemy team. Then, select the map you’re playing on (green for defense, red for offense). We’ll then give you recommendations!</p>
<p>
    The recommendations can also be fine-tuned by setting your proficiency with each heroes. To do so, click on PLAYER SETTINGS on the top right corner, and configure it: -5 means absolutely horrible with the hero, while +5 is your best hero/you’re an expert. The algorithm will consider your skill to match you properly.
